[JSF01] Project: Alpine Challenge

# Project Overview
For the project 'JSF01', I was tasked with using the starter code from the CodeSpace-Academy repo in order to refactor into an Alpine.js based project. The repo included an e-commerce store which uses an api to fetch all the data that is displayed in the store, the store was a React based project that included all the accompanying components to build out the e-commerce store. I had to use my new-found knowledge to accomplish this brief and find a way to complete the brief.   

# Project Brief
- Study and understand the Alpine e-commerce store rubric provided in your student sheet.
- Have a look at the model e-commerce store provided in React: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/jsf-react-ecommerce.
- Study the Fake Store API and see what endpoints you will need to fetch different pieces of data from.
- Code your solution in Alpine.js and document your code with JSDoc.
- Commit changes to your Github repository (remember the naming convention: Module_2_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF01)
- Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set up the project, technologies used and other information specified in the rubric
- Test your application for any bugs and improvements.
- Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository
- Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS JSF01 Submission Project Tab.

# Technologies Used

- Alpine.js: A lightweight JavaScript framework for building dynamic user interfaces.

- TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout.

- Vite: A modern development server and build tool for efficient development and deployment.

- Fake Store API: A RESTful API for fetching e-commerce data.

# How to run the project 
### option 1
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode.
- Open your web browser and navigate to the localhost link to access the e-commerce store.

### option 2
- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Open the index.html file with live server 

# Usage examples 
- Browse through products
- Sort the products by price: highest to lowest and vice versa 
- Filter products by category
- Select products to view their description and reviews


# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
- Learned a lot of new information, techniques, and coding styles but there was no area of mastery for this project 

### Challenges faced 
- One of the main challenges I faced was the Alpine look of code and having to code the project script in shorthand and in the html file. The file looked illegible and complicated for a while until I was able to adjust.

- Another random challenge I faced was dealing with my cvs operations as I had created several repos and keeping up with where I had left off started to become quite a hassle and this added more confusion to my coding process.

### Areas of Improvement 
- I would like to improve my ability to retain new information; from this project I learnt that I don't have a good technique for remembering certain steps quickly and resort to the tried and true method of repetition and practice in order to solidify my understanding and retention of information.   

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience when undertaking this task was very daunting in the beginning as I was not familiar with the Alpine.js syntax and that caused a delay in conversion from idea to code. I was then able to gain comfortability with some of the syntax and this allowed me to gain a better understanding of the Alpine attributes and how I can use them to include functionality within my code. I had a positive experience overall as I got to understand a brand new framework and implement it through refactoring of a familiar framework.
